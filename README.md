# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview

##### This project breaks down data for the ride-sharing company PyBer.  The data includes fares, cities, city types, ride idâ€™s, drivers, dates, and average fare per month. I have created a summary of the data broken down by city type. I have also created a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.  This should enable us to understand how the fares are affected by city type. 


## PyBer Results

##### Each city type had vastly different amounts for fares per driver, fares per ride, and total fares earned. I extrapolated the following from the data:
* Rural rides have an average fare of $34.62 per ride and $55.49 per driver with a total fare of $4,327.93. The total rural rides were 125 with 78 total drivers.
* Suburban rides have an average fare of $30.97 per ride and $39.50 per driver with a total fare of $19,356.33. The total suburban rides were 625 with 490 total drivers.
* Urban rides have an average fare of $24.53 per ride and $16.57 per driver with a total fare of $39,854.38. The total urban rides were 1,625 with 2,405 total drivers.

## PyBer Summary

##### Most of the total profit is earned in urban cities while the highest profit per ride is earned in rural cities. The total profit for urban cities being higher is likely due to the higher population and demand. The fact that urban cities have more competing options against the PyBer services coupled with the distances in rural rides probably being further apart are most likely why the rural profits are higher per ride and driver.  If provided with the companies costs per driver and costs per ride it may be possible to determine which is ultimately more profitable. This data also shows us that currently urban cities are most of the profits so any future advertisement campaigns should be focused on the cities with the most riders.  Finally, it does appear that there may be untapped profits in the rural and suburban city types, and alternative ride sharing types might be recommended, such as vans or busses for longer rides with more people. Below is a line graph to emphasize the disparity in profits in the separate city types.
